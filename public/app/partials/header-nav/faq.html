Bitcoin enables rapid payments (and micropayments) at very low cost, and avoids the need for central authorities and issuers.</p><h4 id="what2">What is Bitstamp?</h4><p>Bitstamp is an European Union based bitcoin marketplace. It allows people from all around the world to safely buy and sell bitcoins.</p><h4 id="work">How does it work?</h4><p>We take cash deposits on one side and bitcoin deposits on the other side of the trade. Then we allow our customers to exchange their cash for bitcoins or vice versa.</p><h4 id="selling">Are you selling bitcoins?</h4><p>No. We are providing a service. You are always buying bitcoins from another individual who is selling them. All we do is provide a safe and simple environment to trade. We guarantee that buyers get their bitcoins and sellers get their money at agreed price.</p><h4 id="start">How to start?</h4><p>It's easy, fast and free to open an account. Click <a href="/account/register/">open an account</a>, fill out the form and log in. Then you have to fund your account. Click deposit in the main menu and select a type of deposit you wish to make. There are two main choices. Bitcoins you wish to sell or currency you wish to spend on buying bitcoins.</p><h4 id="cancel_order">How to cancel an open order?</h4><p>To cancel an open order go to “Account” and select “Open Orders” in the left side menu. Select the order to be canceled and click "Cancel" next to the chosen order. Another option is to click on the "Order Book" and search for an order marked with a green triangle. Click on that order to cancel it.</p><h4 id="trade">How to trade?</h4><p>After you successfully funded your account it is time to trade. Click trade in the main menu. There are two types of orders: instant and limit orders. Instant orders are very simple to use, but limit orders give you the power of setting the price you wish to pay or get for your bitcoins. It is up to you to decide which one to use. We recommend instant orders for people who would like to make a trade as soon as possible and limit orders to people who have experience in market trading.</p><h4 id="limit">How does limit order work?</h4><p>When you place a limit order you decide what price you wish to pay or get. Your order will then be added to the order book and will be waiting for someone to accept it.</p><h4 id="limit2">What if I make a mistake and insert a limit order to buy bitcoins at $50/bitcoin instead of $5/bitcoin?</h4><p>This is a common mistake in the markets and can cause great damage to your account balance and bitcoin market volatility. If you try to commit an order with price greater or lower than 20% of the current market price, our system will ask you for additional confirmation. We will allow you to place any order, but you will be asked if you are sure you want to do that.</p><h4 id="order_book">What is order book?</h4><p>Order book is a list of all open sell and buy orders at the moment. You can buy or sell bitcoins at those prices instantly.</p><h4 id="cost">How much does it cost?</h4><p>Bitstamp charges a trading fee from each party of successful trades made through the market.

Refer to the <a href="/fee_schedule/">fee schedule</a> to determine discount levels. The fee that was charged appears in the account history next to each trade.</p><h4 id="safe">Is it safe to use Bitstamp?</h4><p>Yes! Our main priority is to keep clients personal data safe and secure. We take great precautions around security of our system and are constantly monitoring for any suspicious activities. However we can not provide security for bitcoins stored on users computer, so it is important to take additional steps to ensure that your bitcoin wallet remains protected from users other than yourself.</p><h4 id="deposit_how_long">How long does deposit usually take?</h4><p>A bank wire transfer typically takes 2-5 business days to reach our account.
